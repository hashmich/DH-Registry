Dear <?php echo $name; ?>.

One or more of your entries in the Digital Humanities Course Registry have not been updated for a longer time.

To prevent the registry from showing outdated information, 
please review the listed records. Otherwise, your course information will soon disappear from the DHCR.
Please note, that you must submit the edit form, even if the information did not change.
This will update the 'last-modification-date' of your record. 

If you have many courses, with information that definitely did not change, you may alternatively
make use of the 'revalidate' button on each course row on your dashboard. 
Using this feature saves you from unneccessarily loading the course edit form, if 
your data remains the same.

Please review the linked courses:
<?php
foreach($data as $id => $record) {
	if($id == 'maintainer') continue;
	echo "Course: \n" . $record['Course']['name'] . "\n";
	echo Router::url('/edit/' . $id, $full = true);
	echo "\n\n";
}
?>

Many thanks!
